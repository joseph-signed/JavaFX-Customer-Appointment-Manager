Description of Additional Report:
The additional report I've implemented will generate a series of statements to show which country a customer is from to give the viewer a better idea of their clientele.

Lambda Expressions are in the /src/Program/Lambdas file.

2. Add, create, modify, or remove customers using the buttons and table to select individual customers in the main screen.
3. For appoints, click the "Appointments" button and use the add, create, modify, or remove appointment buttons using the table to select individual appointments.
4. Filter appointments by month and week in the appointments menu by using the week or month filter.
